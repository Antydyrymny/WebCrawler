                    Title: Analyzing Website Structures and Interconnectivity using Web
                    Crawling and D3.js Visualization Abstract: In this scientific work, we
                    present a web-based platform that allows users to explore and
                    visualize the intricate structures of websites through an interactive
                    graph generated using D3.js. The platform utilizes a web crawler
                    script, employing the breadth-first search algorithm to traverse
                    websites efficiently and collect data about their interconnections.
                    Nodes in the graph represent individual pages, while links between
                    nodes signify their associations. This paper discusses the design and
                    implementation of the platform, the challenges faced during its
                    development, and limitations related to certain web technologies.
                    Introduction The vastness and complexity of the internet necessitate
                    innovative tools for analyzing and comprehending website structures.
                    Our platform offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users
                    to enter a domain, prompting the web crawler script to explore and map
                    the entire website. The resulting interactive graph allows users to
                    gain insights into the interconnectivity between pages and understand
                    their relationships. 1.1 Functionality Overview Upon entering a
                    domain, the web crawler starts with the root page and utilizes a
                    breadth-first search algorithm to traverse the website in an efficient
                    manner. As each page is visited, relevant information, such as page
                    URLs and their associated links, is collected and stored in a graph
                    data structure. This data is later processed and visualized using
                    D3.js to create the interactive graph. Graph Visualization The
                    interactive graph represents the website's structure, where nodes
                    correspond to individual pages and links depict the connections
                    between them. Each link is represented by an arrow, indicating the
                    direction of the connection. Bi-directional links are highlighted in
                    blue, signifying mutual associations between pages. Exploring Website
                    Graphs Users can interact with the generated graph by clicking on
                    individual nodes. This action triggers the web crawler to expand the
                    graph further from the selected node, providing a more comprehensive
                    representation of the website's structure. Examples of Website
                    Analysis We present three case studies where popular websites were
                    analyzed using our platform. By clicking on the respective website's
                    image, users can view the graph representation of each site. The case
                    studies demonstrate how our tool can effectively visualize the complex
                    interconnections within different types of websites. Web Crawling and
                    D3.js Implementation The web crawler employs a breadth-first search
                    algorithm, which ensures that the platform traverses websites
                    systematically, avoiding redundancy in data collection. URLs are
                    standardized to prevent inconsistencies in the graph representation.
                    However, certain web technologies, such as websites built with React,
                    pose challenges for the web crawler due to the need for script
                    execution to obtain complete data. Challenges and Solutions During the
                    development of the platform, several challenges were encountered and
                    addressed. Resolving links required careful handling of relative and
                    absolute URLs to ensure accurate graph representation. Standardizing
                    URLs involved considering multiple scenarios, such as handling HTTP
                    and HTTPS versions of a website. To avoid downloading unnecessary
                    data, the crawler was meticulously designed to focus solely on data
                    collection, excluding media files and other non-essential content.
                    Efficient memoization techniques were implemented to optimize the
                    process of updating existing graphs when further exploration from a
                    node is performed. Limitations and Future Work While our platform
                    effectively maps traditional websites, websites built with modern web
                    technologies like React remain a challenge due to the requirement for
                    script execution. In the future, incorporating more advanced
                    techniques for handling JavaScript-driven websites could improve the
                    platform's versatility. Conclusion The web-based platform presented in
                    this work provides an innovative approach to explore and understand
                    the structural complexities of websites. By combining web crawling
                    with D3.js visualization, users can gain valuable insights into the
                    interconnected nature of online content. The challenges faced during
                    the development process have been addressed, and future improvements
                    hold promise for an even more comprehensive analysis of modern web
                    structures.
